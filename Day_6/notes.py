## defining a function:

## use def keyword

def my_function():
    print("my function is operational")
    print("exiting my function")

my_function()

## blocks of code are defined by indentation, similar to {} in JS

# def indentation():
#     if value_1 == true:
#         if value_2 == false:


# while loops work until something changes

while distance_left > 0:
    run()

# this will make your character run until theyve reached the finish line
# given that distance left and run are defined
